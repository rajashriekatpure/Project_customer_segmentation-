# Project_customer_segmentation
## Introduction: 
The project's aim was to identify major customer segments on a transnational data set containing a UK-based non-store online retail business's one-year historical transactions. The company sells unique all-occasion gifts, and many of its customers are wholesalers.

## Data Exploration and Cleaning: 
The first step in the project was to explore and clean the data to understand the relationships between the features.

## RFM Analysis: 
After cleaning and exploring the data, the next step was to perform RFM analysis to identify the Platinum and Gold Customers who bring in more profit to the online retail store. This analysis helped the company focus on Silver and Bronze type customers by organizing attractive offers for them.

## Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithms: 
Next, various unsupervised machine learning algorithms such as KMeans Clustering, DBSCAN Algorithm, and Hierarchical Clustering (Agglomerative Clustering) were implemented to further segment the customers.

## Optimal Number of Clusters: 
The primary challenge was deciding on the optimal number of clusters that would provide meaningful insights. The Elbow method, Silhouette Score, Silhouette Plot, and Dendogram techniques were used to find the optimal number of clusters.

## Customer Segments: 
Two clusters were identified in the dataset. Cluster 0 contained 2414 customers who had a high recency rate but very low frequency and monetary value. The retail business could focus on increasing engagement with these customers. Cluster 1 had a low recency rate, but they were frequent buyers who spent a considerable amount of money on the website, making them the most valuable customer group.

## Conclusion: 
Customer segmentation based on transaction data is essential for online retail businesses. By identifying the optimal number of clusters and analyzing customer data using RFM analysis and unsupervised machine learning algorithms, businesses can identify their most valuable customers and target them with personalized marketing strategies.
