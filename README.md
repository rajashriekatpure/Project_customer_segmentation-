# Project_customer_segmentation
### Introduction:
- The project aimed to segment customers in a UK-based non-store online retail business using one-year historical transactions data.
- The business sells unique all-occasion gifts, and many customers are wholesalers.

### Data Exploration and Cleaning:

- Explored and cleaned the data to understand the relationships between features.

### RFM Analysis:
- Conducted RFM analysis to identify the Platinum and Gold Customers who bring in more profit to the online retail store.
- This analysis helped the company focus on Silver and Bronze type customers by organizing attractive offers for them.
Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithms:

- Implemented unsupervised machine learning algorithms such as KMeans Clustering, DBSCAN Algorithm, and Hierarchical Clustering (Agglomerative Clustering) to segment the customers.

### Optimal Number of Clusters:

- The main challenge was deciding on the optimal number of clusters that would provide meaningful insights.
- Used the Elbow method, Silhouette Score, Silhouette Plot, and Dendogram techniques to find the optimal number of clusters.
Customer Segments:

### Two clusters were identified in the dataset.
- Cluster 0 contained 2414 customers who had a high recency rate but very low frequency and monetary value.
- Cluster 1 had a low recency rate, but they were frequent buyers who spent a considerable amount of money on the website, making them the most valuable customer group.
Conclusion:

### Customer segmentation based on transaction data is essential for online retail businesses.
- By identifying the optimal number of clusters and analyzing customer data using RFM analysis and unsupervised machine learning algorithms, businesses can identify their most valuable customers and target them with personalized marketing strategies.
- More robust analysis that incorporates demographics or product features can lead to even more accurate customer segmentation.
